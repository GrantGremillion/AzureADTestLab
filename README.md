# AzureADTestLab
The purpose of this lab is to walk the user through the process of creating two VM's within Microsoft Azure and then configuring them to work with Active Directory. One of the VM's will work as the domain controller that manages all the network devices while the other will be a client server that non-admin users have access to.
